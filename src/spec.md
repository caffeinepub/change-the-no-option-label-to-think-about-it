# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Valentine question UI so the second option label reads exactly "think about it" instead of "No".

**Planned changes:**
- Change the second option button label on the main "Will you be my Valentine?" screen from "No" to "think about it" (including the moving/avoiding button variant).
- Rebuild and redeploy the updated frontend so the live version reflects the new label.

**User-visible outcome:** On the main Valentine question screen, users see "Yes!" and "think about it" as the two options, and can view/share the updated deployed version.
